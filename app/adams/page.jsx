                The exhibition features a collection of forty-seven works by Ansel Adams (1902 -1984), about two-thirds of a selection Adams made late in his life to serve as a succinct representation of his life’s work. He felt these photographs were his best. Called “The Museum Set”. These works reveal the importance Adams placed on the drama and splendor of natural environments that might not, to the ordinary passing hiker, have revealed their secrets. Included are many of Adams' most famous and best-loved photographs which encompass the full scope of his work: elegant details of nature, architectural studies, portraits, and the breathtaking landscapes for which he is revered. The exhibition also includes a photo portrait of Ansel Adams by James Alinder.
                <br /><br />
                In August of 1978, Gallery owner Maggi Weston of Carmel California approached Ansel Adams with a concept for what was to become the Museum Set Edition of Fine Prints. Adams had wanted a way to make his most important and favorite images available to a wide range of institutions and Maggi's proposal became the perfect solution. Originally it was conceived as a master set of 2500 prints created from 70 images selected by Adams. Though he was able to complete a substantial number of the prints, his death in 1984 curtailed the long range plans for the project.
                <br /><br />
                Adams profoundly influenced the course of 20th century photography not only through the example of his sumptuous and technically precise images, but also by means of his personal energy and devotion to advancing the cause of photography as an art form. As an artist, educator, innovator, and writer, he helped establish many of the institutions that have come to represent the highest aspirations of the medium of photography.
                <br /><br />
                In a career that spanned more than five decades Ansel Adams became one of America’s most beloved landscape photographers and one of its more respected environmentalists. There are few artists whose name and works represent the extraordinary level of popular recognition and artistic achievement as that of Ansel Adams. Writers, critics and fellow artists have presented many reasons for Adams’ popularity. Among them is his deeply held conviction that place matters and that the world around us is a marvel to behold and to respect and honor. There is a poignant and romantic feel to his photographs, as well as a celebration of the beauty of nature.

          Strange as it may seem, Ansel Adams has something in common with Frederic Remington, Grandma Moses, and Norman Rockwell.
          Like the others, Adams is one of the few American artists to have become a household name. He is the only photographer to
          have achieved such an extraordinary level of popular recognition, perhaps in the world. Noted photography scholar John Szarkowski
          refers to “the affection and trust” that Adams enjoyed to an unusual degree from his public. I would like to reflect upon this
          achievement and upon why the work of a particular creative mind becomes beloved by millions, for Adams’s work evokes a very different
          kind of allegiance from that inspired by the works of Remington or Rockwell. Adams’s finest photographs are like stories with happy
          endings, court cases where justice is served, days when everything “clicks.” Like folktales and myth, which satisfy even when told
          over and over, his photographs are exactly the way many people want life to be. They are a fit. They are wish fulfillment. Why?
        </p>
        <p className="text-left mb-4">
          There are dozens of reasons for the popularity of Adams’s photographs, but chief among them is that his work bolsters the human
          being’s deeply held conviction—whether consciously recognized or not—that place matters. Adams’s career spanned a period of unprecedented
          mobility on the part of the American people. Since that circumstance has increased rather than decreased since his death, his work,
          which is so deeply rooted in the celebration of place, strikes a primeval chord. He ventured widely in his travels, yet homes back
          in on his native California with an unwavering sureness. Further, as if benefiting from “home team advantage,” Adams consistently produced
          better work where his heart was, rather than abroad. ”Orchard, Portola Valley, California,” reveals that even the manmade landscape
          of California could inspire him to create exceptional images.
        </p>
        <p className="text-left mb-4">
          There is a poignancy, too, that compels viewers to clasp these images close to the heart. We know that Adams took many of these
          photos so that he could strip the veil from the eyes of the urban American and say, “Look at this!” “Mount Williamson, The Sierra
          Nevada, from Manzanar, California” is one among hundreds of these gripping images. He knew that since the time of Carleton E. Watkins
          in the 1860s and William Henry Jackson in the 1870s, photographs had been a catalyst in this country for the preservation of remarkable
          tracts of land. The sadness in our backward glance stems from our knowledge of how far we’ve fallen from his mark. Ours is an era both
          romantic and selfish, longing to be generous and noble, but addicted to material comforts that too often preclude more far-sighted
          decisions.
        </p>
        <p className="text-left mb-4">
          Like a translator, Adams interprets the voice of nature that for too many of us is no longer understood. It is not a puny, self-questioning
          voice, but a heart-swelling, noble voice that converts opinions about nature into truths. We see his passion, yet we also see what he is
          passionate about and partake of it. He takes something we know we should love and shows us its value in such a way as to erase all further
          doubt. When we see an image like “Monolith, the Face of Half Dome, Yosemite National Park, California” we know it’s worth every bruise and
          insult endured to preserve a place that looks like that, and we know Adams has done something fine—for us, personally. It is not an exaggeration
          to state that he pulls back a curtain to allow us a view of the divine.
        </p>
        <p className="text-left mb-4">
          There is undeniable pride in association with accomplishment, with genius. As Californians, we are proud that Adams is “ours.” When we look
          at his works, we are proud of that spark of recognition, and we blurt out, “I know that piece!” (or, “I know that place!”) as if it were
          an old friend approaching us at a high school reunion. How do we come to feel that we have a right to claim a kind of ownership of another
          person’s work or insider knowledge of what motivated another? Adams, like all artists, has experienced times of greater or lesser popularity
          with critics, but his standing fluctuates within the confines of the highest ranks. His significant position within the history of photography
          is assured. Both specialists and the general public consistently hold his work in high regard. This is a circumstance enjoyed by comparatively
          few artists. To find oneself in accord with professional critics confers on those who have not made a close study of art the feeling of
          possessing artistic judgment. This is by no means cynically meant. In a country where few receive meaningful education in the visual arts,
          those who wish to understand that facet of their own culture face a personal struggle to self-educate, a struggle undertaken by many without
          benefit of a mentor or teacher who can validate their opinions. Having one’s view jibe with the opinion of a critic can be that validation. On
          the other side of the equation, it is deeply important for an artist to connect with the tenor of his own time, and while the greatness of
          many artists lies in their prescience, it devolves upon a select few to work on that knife’s edge between an idea’s coming of age and its
          devalued and superficial over-popularization. Adams was such an artist. In his early allegiance to straight, or uncontrived, photography,
          he bridged the gap between an idea before its time and an idea past its prime.
        </p>
        <p className="text-left mb-4">
          Adams’s popularity also lies in the fact that he starts with the familiar. Aspens, mountain streams, rocky shorelines . . . we already know and
          love these subjects. Upon this foundation, however, he introduces a luminous, scintillating, fragmented clarity like the refracted light from a
          faceted gem. In his photographs the patterns in nature strike us like the pure ringing sound of a staccato beat on a single instrument. “Frozen
          Lake and Cliffs, The Sierra Nevada, Sequoia National Park, California,” for instance, is so abstract in its emphasis on pattern that many viewers
          must look hard at it to discern the subject. Adams’s work differs from the storied, velvety, arcane, and brutal photographic images of his contemporaries
          Weston, Strand, Cunningham, or Lange. There is a sensuousness tempered by intellect in Adams’s work; it further cements the connection between the
          thing depicted and what the viewer already knows. Through his meticulous selection from among all the variables of exposure, filter, position, and
          myriad other factors, Adams created a rationalized naturalness, free of the discomfort of chaos. Life is the essence of Adams’s work—a majestic and
          perfect life—and it is this quality of life that distinguishes it from the work of photographers whose technical acumen rivaled his. The viewer senses
          a breathing entity in an Adams tree or cliff face, not a relic. He does not merely document a scene that the viewer is expected to see as static and
          part of the past. Rather, by evoking the beauty of living stillness—which we all know already from personal experience—he taps into the essential
          connection between human beings and the natural world. In short, we feel akin to his subjects.
          <br />
          <br />
          But surely the factor that is central to the singular fondness that continues to be accorded to Adams and his work is what we know about him as a person.
          Nothing we learn about Adams’s convictions and actions during his lifetime tarnishes or compromises our appreciation of his art. On the contrary, the
          way in which his roles as committed preservationist, teacher, and artist meld and become one convinces us of the genuineness of his passion and his
          aesthetic vision. He convinces us that life and art can be one, and affirms our increasingly desperate need to know that such imponderables as nobility,
          integrity, and compassion do exist. Adams was an egalitarian artist whose primary concern was to be inclusive and accessible, rather than elitist. Adams
          used the following words of another man, but he could just as well have applied them to himself: “To him nature was a fundamental reality, and it is not
          surprising that he should have made it the basis of his expression . . . not as an end in itself but as a means of revealing something more elemental
          and more eternal.”
          <br />
          <br />
          Ansel Adams’s photographs—and the vision that inspired them—are perhaps more necessary now than ever. The world is desperately in need of idealism,
          and yet we find it so often betrayed by the folly of our actions and the failure to realize our promises. Adams’s work is fundamentally utopian, not
          in the sense of being divorced from reality, but in the sense of providing a glimpse of what could be.
          <br />
          <br />
          At the same time that Adams provides us with a vision of a state of grace, he also proffers an idealization of the American West that resonates with many
          who share his cultural values. There is a quality of the sublime in his work—its images echo the landscape of a mythic land of opportunity that promises
          solace and renewal. Whether or not we see ourselves as participants in the grand mythology of the American West, Adams’s imagery seems to have attained
          a universal quality, such that the beauty of the natural world is indeed manifest in its highest form. It is, in many ways, a form of idealism that is
          uncomfortably realistic and which dares us to consider the possibility that the world could be as magnificent as he portrayed it.
