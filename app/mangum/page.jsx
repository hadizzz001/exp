                  In the late 1890s, self-taught photographer Hugh Mangum
                  (1877-1922), began riding the rails as an itinerant portraitist,
                  traveling primarily in North Carolina and Virginia. Mangum worked
                  during the rise of the Jim Crow era, a period in which laws were
                  passed throughout the South to enforce segregation. Despite this,
                  his portraits reveal a clientele that was both racially and
                  economically diverse and show lives marked by notable affluence
                  and hardship, all imbued with a strong sense of individuality and
                  self-creation. Mangum took over 12,000 portraits during his
                  lifetime.

                  One of the profound surprises of Mangum’s photography is its
                  artistic freshness. He had a charm and curiosity that is often
                  reflected in the faces of his sitters. In other images, Mangum’s
                  presence as a photographer is invisible and the sitters appear
                  lost in their own private, interior worlds. Mangum’s ability to
                  capture these moments of vulnerability and intense self-recognition
                  lies at the heart of his gift as a photographer.

                  After his unexpected death in 1922, Mangum’s glass plate
                  negatives were stored in a barn on his family’s farm in Durham.
                  Slated for demolition in the 1970s, the barn was saved at the
                  last moment, and with it, this surprising and unparalleled
                  document of life during a turbulent time in the history of the
                  southern United States. His negatives are not only images; they
                  are objects that have survived a history of their own and exist
                  within a larger political and cultural history. They hint at
                  unexpected relationships and stories, and confirm how early
                  photographs have the power to subvert common historical narratives.

                  The color prints in the exhibition were made from digital scans
                  of black-and-white, dry glass plate negatives exposed and
                  processed by photographer Hugh Mangum at the turn of the
                  twentieth century. Salvaged in the 1970s and donated to Duke
                  University in 1986, Mangum’s glass plates were then
                  professionally cleaned and stabilized by highly trained
                  conservators. In the 2000s, they were photographed in high
                  resolution color with a digital camera. The original negatives,
                  with all their damage and decay, reveal vibrant portraits of
                  forgotten individuals. The scratches, cracks, fingerprints, and
                  delicate color shifts that surround and sometimes cover the
                  sitters’ faces give them new meaning. Taken more than a century
                  ago but printed in 2018, these photographs suggest that the
                  distance between the past and the present is closer than imagined.

      Brief Biography of Hugh Mangum
    </p>
    <p className="mb-4">
      Hugh Mangum was born in 1877 in the tobacco-fueled boomtown of Durham, North Carolina. The eldest of five children in a hard-working, well-respected family with a web of kinship that spread out across the county, Mangum considered himself an artist from a young age. In order to pursue his education in the fine arts, Mangum pushed the boundaries of what was generally considered appropriate for a man’s schooling at the time. As a boy, he took art classes at the Methodist Female Seminary in Durham and later studied art at Salem College, in Winston-Salem, the oldest educational institution for girls and women in the United States. When Mangum was sixteen, his family moved from downtown to a farm at West Point on the Eno where he built his first darkroom. By 1897, he was making studio portraits and in 1899 began working as an itinerant portraitist. In 1906, Mangum married Annie Carden of East Radford, Virginia, and settled there. He returned often to Durham and continued to set up temporary studios in railroad towns across Virginia, North Carolina, and West Virginia until at least 1912. After a fire destroyed his Radford studio in 1919, Mangum took over a well established permanent studio in nearby Roanoke, moving his family there in 1921. Hugh Mangum died of pneumonia in Roanoke in 1922 at age forty-four.

    <p className="mb-4">
      Part of what makes Hugh Mangum’s work such an extraordinary contribution to both the historical record and the history of photography was his method of recording multiple portraits on a single glass plate negative. For most of his portrait work, Mangum used a Penny Picture camera—a small and somewhat rare camera, mounted on a tripod and equipped with movable backs. These backs held the glass plate negative behind the lens and could be made to slide vertically and horizontally. Through a step-and-repeat process, it was possible for Mangum to record multiple exposures in rows and columns, creating a grid-like pattern of individual images on a single plate. These multiple-image plates provide viewers today with an unintended record of the succession of sitters who passed through Hugh Mangum’s studio on any given day.

        className="mx-auto"
      />
    </div>
    <p className="mb-4">
      When traveling, Mangum announced his arrival on printed broadsides. Some of these advertisements survived, stacked among his glass plate negatives. They promote “All Kinds of Pictures” and “Specials to School Children.” “Come at once,” Mangum urged in underlined letters, “and avoid the rush.”
